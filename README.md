# ElectionKata
A shorthand feed with election results must be transformed into a user friendly statistical format

## Results format

```
As an election data analyst
Given a short hand version of the election results
I want the election results converted to a specific format
```

The fields in the data input will be separated by commas but each row will vary in length as described below.

A result will consist of:

1. A constituency
2. A repeating set of pairs with the party code and the votes cast

So for example:

    Cardiff West, 11014, C, 17803, L, 4923, UKIP, 2069, LD
    Islington South & Finsbury, 22547, L, 9389, C, 4829, LD, 3375, UKIP, 3371, G, 309, Ind

We want to transform this into a standard result that shows:

* the constituency name
* translates the party code into a full name
* shows the share of the vote as a percentage of all the votes cast

For example:

    Cardiff West || Conservative Party | 30.76% || Labour Party | 49.72% || UKIP | 13.75% || Liberal Democrats | 5.78%
    Islington South & Finsbury || Labour Party | 51.45% || Conservative Party | 21.43% || Liberal Democrats | 11.02% || UKIP | 7.70% || Green Party | 7.69% || Independent | 0.71%

### Codes

* C - Conservative Party
* L - Labour Party
* UKIP - UKIP
* LD - Liberal Democrats
* G - Green Party
* Ind - Independent
* SNP - SNP
